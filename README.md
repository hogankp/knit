**Note**: This is work in progress and subject to breaking changes.

Knit parses knitting patterns into a parse tree.

To make this work reliably, we define a simple and relatively
strict pattern syntax. There are established knitting pattern formats
out there, but they are not strict enough to be suitable for parsing
in a practical and efficient manner.

The pattern constructs we do support are taken from the overview on
[craftyarncouncil.com](http://www.craftyarncouncil.com/knit.html).


### Pattern syntax

The lowest syntax level concerns the actual pattern constructs we
recognize and these are only a small handful of minimal
components we need to build everything else (see below).
All constructs are case insensitive.


### Rows

A single pattern can define stitch sequences for multiple rows.
A row can be denoted with the `Row` keyword. It can optionally be
followed by a number, indicating which row this represents.

Any pattern data following this Row node, up until the end of the
pattern, or the next Row node, should be considered part of the same
row. For example:

	Row 1: P10 K10 P10
	Row 2: K10 P10 K10

This pattern defines the stitching sequences for two distinct rows.


### Stitch kinds

* `K`: Knit stitch
* `P`: Purl stitch
* `Ks`: Knitwise Slip stitch
* `Ps`: Purlwise Slip stitch
* `Co`: CastOn
* `Bo`: BindOff
* `Inc`: Increase
* `Dec`, `tog`: Decrease
* `Yo`: Yarn over
* `K2Tog`, `K3Tog`, `K4Tog`: Knit N together.
* `P2Tog`, `P3Tog`, `P4Tog`: Purl N together.
* `Ca`: Single Cable stitch
* `Psso`: Pass second to last sitch over last one.
* `Ssk`: Slip-slip-knit
* `Ssp`: Slip-slip-purl


Stitches can be directly followed by a quantifier (see below), in order
to determine how often they should be repeated. For example `P3 K2` means:
Three Purl stitches, followed by two Knit stitches.

Stitches can be prefixed with a modifier (see below). These specify some special
usecase for the particular stitch. For example `@P2 @K3` means: Two Purl
stitches through back loop, followed by three Knit stitches through back loop.


### Groupings

Any sequence of stitches can be encased in `[` and `]`, to turn it into a
distinct grouping. A group can have its own quantifiers (see below), to
determine how often it should be repeated.

For example `[p3 k3] 10` means: Three Purl stitches, followed by three
knit stitches. And repeat the whole block ten times.


### Quantifiers

Quantifiers specify the repetition count for a given stitch or group.
They consist of absolute numbers (`1`, `2`, etc) and specify an absolute
number of repetitions for the preceeding stitch or group.

Every stitch and group has an implicit quantifier of `1`.
There is therefore no need to specify it in the pattern if all you need is
for it to be knitted once.

E.g.: `PK` means one Purl Stitch, followed by one Knit stitch.
It is functionally identical to the pattern `P1K1`. 


### Modifiers

Modifiers specify unique attributes for a given stitch. These are tokens
which directly preceed the stitch name. Multiple modifiers can be applied
to a single stitch.

Known modifiers include:

* `@`: Denotes that the stitch is to be worked through the back loop instead
  of the front loop.
* `^`: Knit deep (previous row).
* `>`: Yarn Forward. Meaning, we pass the working yarn to the front of the work,
  like one would do for a normal Purl stitch.
* `<`: Yarn backward. Meaning, we pass the working yarn to the back of the work,
  like one would do for a normal Knit stitch.


For example `@P2 ^K3` means: Two Purl stitches through back loop, followed by
three deep Knit stitches.


### Pattern Nesting

In addition, we allow other patterns to be referenced by name.
This allow us to split large patterns up into smaller, managable chunks and
build more complex patterns by embedding the ready-made building blocks.

For example, pattern 'abc' is defined as `[P3 K3] 5`.
Pattern 'xyz' can incorporate 'abc' by referencing it by name: `P10 abc 2 P10`.


### Reference Expansion

The parser does not expand the reference to 'abc' during parsing, but it
is left in there as a `Reference` node with the name `abc`. It is up to the
host application to supply the actual contents of this reference during use.
Alternatively, one can instruct the pattern to do so by calling the
`Pattern.Expand(ReferenceHandler)` method.

The host application must implement the `ReferenceHandler` and it should
return a valid, compiled pattern for the supplied reference name.
`Expand` expands all references in place.

For example:

	a, err := Parse("abc", "[P3 K3] 5")
	b, err := Parse("xyz", "P10 abc 2 P10")
	err := b.Expand(...)

'xyz' is now:

	P10 [[P3 K3] 5] 2 P10


### Loop unrolling

The parser does not do loop unrolling by default. However, it can be
instructed to do so by calling the `Pattern.Unroll()` method.

For example:

	P2 K3 [P INC 2] 2

Will become:

	P P K K K P INC INC P INC INC

This is mostly practical when using the pattern to generate some other
form of output. Getting rid of the nested groupings like this makes
processing considerably easier.

After a call to `Pattern.Unroll`, there should be no Number or Group nodes
left in the pattern. Only a flat list of Stitch nodes and optionally some
Reference nodes if `Pattern.Expand` was not yet called.
